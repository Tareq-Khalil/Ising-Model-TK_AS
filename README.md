# 3D Ising Model Simulation

This project simulates and visualizes the behavior of a 3D Ising model, which is commonly used in statistical physics to study phase transitions and magnetization in materials. The code generates a 3D lattice of spins and analyzes their behavior at different temperatures relative to the critical temperature Tc. Additionally, it visualizes key physical properties such as magnetization, energy, specific heat capacity, and susceptibility.

## Usage Guide

The simulation examines the system under different temperature conditions relative to the critical temperature Tc = 2.27:

- **High Temperature (T > Tc):**  
  - Spins are randomly oriented (disordered phase).
- **Critical Temperature (T ≈ Tc):**  
  - The system shows a mix of order and disorder (critical phase).
- **Low Temperature (T < Tc):**  
  - Spins are aligned uniformly (ordered phase).

The script generates the following plots:

1. **3D Lattice Visualization:**  
   - Displays the spatial distribution of spins.
2. **Magnetization vs. Temperature:**  
   - Shows how spin alignment changes with temperature.
3. **Energy vs. Temperature:**  
   - Demonstrates energy variations in the system.
4. **Specific Heat Capacity vs. Temperature:**  
   - Measures heat response to temperature changes.
5. **Susceptibility vs. Temperature:**  
   - Analyzes the system’s response to an external field.
6. **Magnetization vs. Magnetic Field:**  
   - Shows how magnetization responds to external forces.
7. **Energy vs. Magnetic Field:**  
   - Tracks energy variation with magnetic field strength.
